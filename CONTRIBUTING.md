# Contributing to Project Title

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and 
transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as
accept pull requests.

We use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow),
so all code changes happen through Pull Requests.

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!
